experimental
there was dust when the sheet was removed from the control panel 
the voice was crisp and adrenaline rush 
white flag was moving when the plane started taking off and rushing forward 
the co=pilot was sitting on the right side
the feeling stays fresh even after so many years of flying 
this routine was followed every time before the plane was taking off
