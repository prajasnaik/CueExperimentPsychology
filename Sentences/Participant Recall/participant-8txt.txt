It was a regular flight check for Ria. 
She had her co-pilot sitting on her right side. 
They were checking the control panel. 
She gave a thumbs up to the ground control to indicate everything was working fine and they were ready to take off. 
She got the usual adrenal rush she gets during her flights when they started their plane.
