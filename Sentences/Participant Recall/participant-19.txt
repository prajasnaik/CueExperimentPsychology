experimental
Ria a pilot who wanted to fly an airplane and leave the city for good. 
Like always she had an rush of adrenaline moments before taking of. 
A tree was in front of the airplane outside the runway and the white flag blowing in the air with full pressure which she saw before take off. 
And before all that, when she entered the cock pit she saw her co pilot had already taken the right side seat and she took the look at the controls which was all dusty. 
She gave a clear signal after checking all the controls and then as described above she took off, leaving the city with a sigh of relief.
