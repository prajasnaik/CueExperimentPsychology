The scene described two people, a female pilot and a male pilot. 
While the male pilot was already sat in his seat and his hands on the control panel, 
the woman was excited for the departure of the plane from the city she particularly did not like. 
She was excited for her dinner and said something along the lines of “ready to take off”, 
she viewed a tree in the distance before confirming the take off. 
Also the beginning of the scene describes her eyes to be filled with excitement. 
Also the control panel of the aeroplane was dusty.
